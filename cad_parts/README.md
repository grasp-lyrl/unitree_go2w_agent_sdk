# CAD Parts Directory

This folder contains CAD resources and documentation for the project. Below is an overview of the available contents:

## Structure

- **BOM.csv**: Bill of Materials listing all parts used in the assembly.
- **parts/**: Contains 3D models and images of individual parts.
  - **png/**: Rendered images of parts (e.g., `adapter_plate_camera.png`, `assem.png`, `mount_plate.png`, `side_mount_real.png`).
  - **steps/**: 3D models in STEP format for CAD software (e.g., `adapter_plate_camera.STEP`, `Assem1.STEP`, `mount_plate.STEP`, `side_mount_real.STEP`).
  - **stl/**: 3D models in STL format for 3D printing (e.g., `adapter_plate_camera.STL`, `mount_plate.STL`, `side_mount_real.STL`).
- **png/**: Additional images, such as assembly diagrams or reference images (e.g., `assembled.png`, `roadkill.png`).

## Usage
- Use the STEP files for editing or viewing in CAD software.
- Use the STL files for 3D printing.
- Refer to the PNG images for visual reference or assembly guidance.
- Check the BOM.csv for a complete list of parts and materials.
